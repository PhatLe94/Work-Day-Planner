Work Day Scheduler

This calendar application was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while using Bootstrap & jQuery.

The Work Day schedule displays work hours 8AM - 5PM and also displays current Month, Day, Year / Hours, Minutes, Seconds.

For each time block it will display 3 colors depending on the time of day: Gray (Past), Red (Present), Green (Future).
(_Keep in mind, if you are viewing this html link after 5PM, the time blocks will be GRAYED OUT_)

When the user types in any time block, the user can click on the blue icon and it will store in their local storage.
